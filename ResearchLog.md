ENG 235- TECHNICAL WRITING

# Week 1

•	Describe your own initial understandings and assumptions about "technical writing" as you start the course. How do your initial understandings/assumptions align (or not) with the work we have done so far?
My initial understanding of “technical writing” was writing used in real life situations such as resumes or memos. It has aligned in the aspect that we are using it to teach in real life situations such as instruction sets. 
•	Reflect on your experience in composing these instruction sets -- attempt to describe all of the choices you made in the process of realizing your composition. In light of our usability testing -- what, if anything, would you revise or change about your instruction set in order to improve it?
When given the task I first had to decide what I was going to make, ensure I had the required amount of pieces, looked on the Lego website to find the proper name for the pieces, took pictures of each step, typed up step-by-step and added the steps to the pictures, ensured it was in the right order, worked on setting to make into a booklet, numbered the pages in the booklet in case pages were mixed up. If I were to revise anything it would be to change the settings back on the word document so it would be easier to look at online as well. 
•	Technical Writing -- like any field or category of writing -- is rhetorically situated. That means that questions of audience are essential considerations to what's produced. Even though this is a classroom exercise -- what sense of audience for these instructions do you have? How, if at all, has this sense of audience -- that you are designing this text for a reader -- informed the choices you made in producing the composition? 
The sense of audience I believe I had was knowing what the audience had available to view the instructions. The audience understood what the criteria in the instruction set were since they were present for the instructions. I knew when producing the text that I would need to have an electronic copy of the instructions and not just write it out. 
•	I have left it up to you as to how you deliver your instructional text to your audience. You could choose Word, PowerPoint, HTML or any number of mediums or platforms. How did you decide to deliver your composition and what factors motivated that choice? Ultimately, what do you think your choice of delivery medium/platform get you as a writer? 
I chose the platform I was most familiar with. I knew if I used PowerPoint it would take a bit longer for me to research how to use certain features. 
•	Describe and reflect on your work in setting up an account and repository on GitHub. The "Hello World" tutorial/guide on GitHub is an example of tech writing. What did you notice about it? Perhaps more importantly, what might you learn from it? What's at least one thing you might take away from the GitHub "Hello World" tutorial that you could apply to your own instructional set in order to improve it? 
Setting up Github was a bit difficult starting out. I will have to work on it more to get a better grasp at it. I noticed it does assist you in recommending things such as merging or deleting duplicates. One thing I could take away is that it allows you to seeing edits done to the file, this will help when working on projects with others.
•	Finally, what do you think you learned this week? Keep in mind that your learning might resonate with particular course outcomes or personal outcomes or even something unexpected or not entirely anticipated by either articualted course or personal outcomes.
I learned that technical writing is translating material to everyday language and that designs do not need to be text, it can be any material available that helps the user understand the product or program, learned about the different resources available when working on projects, I also learned that technical writing is wide variety of things such as instructional sets or even zines.
